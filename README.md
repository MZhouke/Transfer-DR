# Affordable DR Monitoring Using Transfer Learning and Data Preprocessing
This project aims to develop a cost-effective solution for monitoring diabetic retinopathy (DR) using transfer learning and data preprocessing techniques. The goal is to leverage pre-trained deep learning models to detect signs of DR in retinal images and provide early detection and monitoring of the disease.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection dataset from Kaggle. It contains over 35,000 retinal images with labels indicating the severity of DR, ranging from 0 (no DR) to 4 (proliferative DR). The images are of varying sizes and quality, and some may have artifacts or other abnormalities.

# Preprocessing
To preprocess the dataset, we first resize all the images to a common size of 224x224 pixels and convert them to grayscale to reduce the input dimensionality. We then normalize the pixel values to the range [0, 1] and perform data augmentation by randomly flipping and rotating the images during training.

# Transfer Learning
We use transfer learning to leverage the pre-trained ResNet50 model, which has been trained on millions of images and has learned to recognize a wide range of features. We replace the final fully connected layer of the ResNet50 model with a new layer that has 5 output nodes, one for each severity level of DR. We then train the model on our preprocessed dataset using the cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

# Training and Evaluation
We train the model for a specified number of epochs and evaluate its performance on a held-out validation set. We monitor the validation loss and accuracy to detect overfitting and early stopping is used to prevent further training if the validation loss does not improve after a certain number of epochs.

# Results


# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of transfer learning and data preprocessing for developing cost-effective solutions for medical image analysis. By leveraging pre-trained models and carefully preprocessing the data, we can achieve high accuracy with minimal resources and provide early detection and monitoring of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy.
